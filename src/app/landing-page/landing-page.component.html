    Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most
    important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, 
    exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. 
    In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, 
    diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers.
